# Convolutional Neural Networks using Radial Basis Functions
This project aims to create a CNN using mostly RBF-Neurons. Usually CNNs use a convolutional layer only consisting of linear operations, while this model is using a radial basis function to achieve the convolutional as well as the classification.

Note that this network technically speaking is also using a linear neuron and a soft-max layer in order to achieve some functionality so it is not purely consisting of RBF-Neurons.
